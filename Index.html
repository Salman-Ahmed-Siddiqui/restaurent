                    <h2>Delicious Food</h2>
                    <p>If you’ve ever been to a Pakistani buffet, you’ve probably been overwhelmed by the plethora of mouth-watering dishes available to you. You won’t go wrong with whichever food you end up sampling—each Pakistani dish comes contains a unique flavor and will satisfy your palate.

                     That being said, we’d be remiss if we didn’t say we have our biases. Here are seven very famous Pakistani dishes that we think you’d enjoy the most even if you haven’t tasted it before:</p>

              <h3>1.Biryani</h3>

              <p>This dish is perhaps the best-known of the bunch. Biryani is a rice dish combined with either chicken, mutton, or beef. It is best known for its delicious Basmati rice,made yellow by turmeric and other spices and herbs.

               Biryani also benefits from perfectly cooked tomatoes, potatoes, and lemons for added aromatics, texture, and complementing flavors.</p>
           
               <h3>2.Beef Kebab</h3>

               <p>Another famous Pakistani food is the Beef Kebab, which is well-seasoned beef grilled to succulent perfection. Kebabs are traditionally skewered with onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers.

                  Beef Kebabs can be eaten alone; however, they can also be paired with herb-infused rice or wrapped in a warm pita.</p>
           
                  <h3>3.Samosas</h3>

                  <p>Supposed to be eaten as a light snack, samosas are incredibly filling—so much so that they can spoil the main dishes if you’re not careful with your portions! These are mainly boiled potatoes, green chilies, and finely chopped herbs wrapped in a flour-coated triangular crust. They can also come stuffed with minced lamb, chicken, or beef.</p>
